Trello Chore Rotator
====================

This project was a way for me to get familiar with trello's API and have fun 
with it

It is meant to be run on a Sunday using the following List format in Trello

```
Daily Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
```

You will need to acquire a token and key from Trello to use this script.

Application Key
```
https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate
```

Application Token
```
https://trello.com/1/authorize?key=SUBSTITUTEWITHYOURAPPLICATIONKEY&name=My+Application&expiration=30days&response_type=token
```

Use CURL or some RESTClient to get the token from trello.
